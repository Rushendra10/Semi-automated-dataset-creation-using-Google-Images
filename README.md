# Semi-automated-dataset-creation-using-Google-Images

-> First the user has to set the word/phrase that is to be googled and the path to which the images are to be saved.

-> The script will open a new window and search for the given word/phrase (autonomously) and will select the first picture that comes up.

-> From there, the user can press the key 'Y' for saving that picture and 'N' for rejecting that picture.

-> The end goal is to have a somewhat easier method to create a small dataset (small compared to datasets like Imagenet).

-> I began this project (more like a mini-project) to experiment with Selenium but I ended up learning a lot more about chromedrivers and python libraries.
